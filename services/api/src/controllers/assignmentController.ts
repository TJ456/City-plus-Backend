/**
 * ðŸŽ¯ ASSIGNMENT CONTROLLER - Incident-Resource Matching System
 * 
 * Purpose: Manages the assignment of resources to incidents for optimal response
 * Architecture: Intelligent matching with real-time coordination
 * Usage: Core routing logic that connects emergency incidents with appropriate resources
 */

// STEP 1: Import required dependencies
// TODO: Set up assignment controller dependencies
// - Import Express types: Request, Response, NextFunction
// - Import database client and Prisma types
// - Import logger for assignment tracking
// - Import event emitter for assignment events
// - Import notification service for real-time updates

// STEP 2: Define assignment request/response interfaces
// TODO: Create TypeScript interfaces for assignment API
// - CreateAssignmentRequest: incidentId, resourceId, priority
// - AssignmentResponse: full assignment data with incident and resource info
// - AssignmentStatusUpdate: status, notes, estimatedArrival
// - BulkAssignmentRequest: multiple resource assignments
// - AssignmentMetrics: performance and timing statistics

// STEP 3: Implement create assignment endpoint
// TODO: Create POST /assignments endpoint
// - Validate incident and resource IDs exist and are valid
// - Check resource availability before assignment
// - Verify incident is not already resolved
// - Calculate assignment priority based on incident severity
// - Create assignment record with PENDING status
// - Emit ASSIGNMENT_CREATED event for notifications
// - Send real-time notification to resource owner
// - Return assignment details with estimated response time

// STEP 4: Implement automatic resource matching
// TODO: Create POST /assignments/auto-match endpoint
// - Find available resources matching incident requirements
// - Calculate proximity scores for geospatial matching
// - Consider resource capabilities vs incident needs
// - Factor in resource reliability and past performance
// - Apply load balancing to prevent resource overutilization
// - Create multiple assignments for complex incidents
// - Return ranked list of potential assignments

// STEP 5: Implement get assignments endpoint
// TODO: Create GET /assignments endpoint with filtering
// - Support pagination for large assignment lists
// - Filter by status (pending, accepted, in progress, completed)
// - Filter by incident category or severity
// - Filter by resource type or organization
// - Filter by date range and geographic area
// - Include incident and resource summary information
// - Support real-time updates via WebSocket

// STEP 6: Implement get assignment by ID endpoint
// TODO: Create GET /assignments/:id endpoint
// - Validate assignment ID and check permissions
// - Include complete incident and resource details
// - Show assignment timeline and status history
// - Display communication logs between parties
// - Include performance metrics and feedback
// - Show real-time location updates if available

// STEP 7: Implement assignment status updates
// TODO: Create PUT /assignments/:id/status endpoint
// - Allow resource owners to accept or reject assignments
// - Support status progression: PENDING â†’ ACCEPTED â†’ IN_PROGRESS â†’ COMPLETED
// - Handle assignment rejection with reason codes
// - Update resource availability based on assignment status
// - Emit status change events for real-time notifications
// - Log all status changes with timestamps and users

// STEP 8: Implement assignment coordination features
// TODO: Create assignment management endpoints
// - PUT /assignments/:id/location: Update resource location during response
// - POST /assignments/:id/notes: Add coordination notes and updates
// - PUT /assignments/:id/eta: Update estimated arrival time
// - POST /assignments/:id/contact: Direct communication between parties
// - GET /assignments/:id/timeline: View complete assignment timeline

// STEP 9: Implement assignment optimization
// TODO: Create intelligent assignment optimization
// - Algorithm to find optimal resource-incident pairings
// - Consider multiple factors: distance, capability, availability
// - Handle resource conflicts and scheduling
// - Implement assignment rebalancing for changing conditions
// - Support priority escalation for critical incidents
// - Dynamic reassignment based on new information

// STEP 10: Implement assignment analytics
// TODO: Create GET /assignments/analytics endpoint
// - Assignment success and completion rates
// - Average response and resolution times
// - Resource utilization and performance metrics
// - Geographic response pattern analysis
// - Assignment rejection reasons and trends
// - Bottleneck identification in assignment process

// STEP 11: Add assignment validation and quality control
// TODO: Implement assignment validation system
// - Verify resource capability matches incident requirements
// - Check resource certifications and qualifications
// - Validate geographic feasibility of assignments
// - Monitor assignment progress and intervene if needed
// - Quality scoring for completed assignments
// - Feedback collection from all parties

// STEP 12: Implement bulk assignment operations
// TODO: Create bulk assignment management
// - POST /assignments/bulk: Create multiple assignments
// - PUT /assignments/bulk-update: Update multiple assignments
// - Handle large-scale incidents requiring many resources
// - Coordinate multi-resource response teams
// - Manage assignment dependencies and sequencing
// - Support assignment templates for common scenarios

// STEP 13: Add emergency assignment protocols
// TODO: Implement emergency assignment features
// - POST /assignments/emergency: High-priority assignment routing
// - Automatic escalation for critical unassigned incidents
// - Emergency broadcast to all available resources
// - Override normal assignment rules for emergencies
// - Fast-track assignment approval for critical situations
// - Emergency contact protocols for failed assignments

// STEP 14: Export controller functions
// TODO: Export all assignment management functions
// - Export CRUD and status management functions
// - Export matching and optimization algorithms
// - Export analytics and reporting functions
// - Export emergency and bulk operation handlers
