/** 
 * ðŸ“¡ COMMON EVENTS - Cross-Service Communication Contract

 * Purpose: Defines the event-driven architecture foundation for CityPulse
 * Usage: Shared between API service (event emitters) and Worker service (event consumers)
 * Architecture: Enables loose coupling between microservices through event messaging
 */

// STEP 1: Define incident-related event constants
// TODO: Create constants for incident lifecycle events
// - INCIDENT_REPORTED: When a new incident is submitted by a citizen
// - INCIDENT_CLASSIFIED: When ML/rules classify the incident category
// - INCIDENT_DUPLICATED: When system detects duplicate incident reports
// - INCIDENT_RESOLVED: When incident is marked as resolved

// STEP 2: Define resource-related event constants  
// TODO: Create constants for resource management events
// - RESOURCE_REGISTERED: When volunteer/NGO registers new resource
// - RESOURCE_AVAILABLE: When resource becomes available for assignment
// - RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE: When resource is busy or offline
// - RESOURCE_LOCATION_UPDATED: When resource updates its GPS location

// STEP 3: Define assignment-related event constants
// TODO: Create constants for resource-incident matching events  
// - ASSIGNMENT_CREATED: When system assigns resource to incident
// - ASSIGNMENT_ACCEPTED: When resource accepts the assignment
// - ASSIGNMENT_REJECTED: When resource rejects the assignment
// - ASSIGNMENT_COMPLETED: When assignment is marked as completed

// STEP 4: Define user-related event constants
// TODO: Create constants for user management events
// - USER_REGISTERED: When new user signs up to the platform
// - USER_VERIFIED: When user completes verification process
// - TRUST_SCORE_UPDATED: When user's trust score is recalculated

// STEP 5: Define notification event constants
// TODO: Create constants for real-time notification events
// - NOTIFICATION_SEND: When system needs to send notification to user
// - ALERT_BROADCAST: When emergency alert needs to be broadcasted
// - STATUS_UPDATE: When incident/assignment status needs to be communicated

// STEP 6: Create event payload type definitions
// TODO: Define TypeScript interfaces for event data structures
// - IncidentEventPayload: Data structure for incident events
// - ResourceEventPayload: Data structure for resource events  
// - AssignmentEventPayload: Data structure for assignment events
// - NotificationEventPayload: Data structure for notification events

// STEP 7: Export event emitter utility functions
// TODO: Create helper functions for event emission
// - emitEvent(): Generic event emitter function
// - validateEventPayload(): Validate event data before emission
// - logEvent(): Log event for audit trail

// STEP 8: Create event listener utility functions  
// TODO: Create helper functions for event consumption
// - addEventListener(): Generic event listener registration
// - removeEventListener(): Clean event listener removal
// - handleEventError(): Error handling for failed event processing
