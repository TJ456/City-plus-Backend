Yes ✅ — the **CityPulse backend skeleton** I gave you is following a **microservices-style architecture**, not a monolith.

Here’s why:

---

### **Why It’s Microservices**

1. **Multiple independent services**

   * `services/api` → Main REST API server (serves user-facing requests)
   * `services/auth` → Authentication & authorization (runs separately)
   * `services/worker` → Background job processing (e.g., notifications, data cleanup)

2. **Separate `package.json` for each service**

   * Each service has **its own dependencies** and scripts.
   * You can **deploy or scale them independently** (e.g., run 5 API instances but only 1 worker).

3. **Shared code in `/packages/common`**

   * Instead of duplicating utilities, shared logic lives here and is imported by all services.

4. **Runs concurrently in development**

   * In dev mode, the root `package.json` uses `concurrently` to start all three services at once.

---

### **How This Works in Practice**

* If **API** needs to change, you can redeploy **just the API container**.
* If **worker** jobs are slow, you can spin up **more worker instances** without touching auth or API.
* If **auth** service is under attack or needs an update, the other services keep running.

---

### **Microservices Trade-offs**

✅ **Pros**

* Scalability — deploy and scale each service as needed
* Clear separation of concerns — services have distinct responsibilities
* Easier to assign teams to services

❌ **Cons**

* More complex local setup (need to run multiple processes)
* Communication overhead between services (often via REST, gRPC, or message queues)
* More DevOps complexity in production

---

If you prefer, we could **restructure CityPulse into a monolith** — meaning one `package.json`, one server process, and all routes/middleware/jobs living in one codebase.
That’s easier for solo projects but less realistic for hackathon scalability pitches.

---

If you want to **impress hackathon judges**, keeping it **microservices** is better because you can say:

> “We designed CityPulse with a scalable microservices architecture — API, authentication, and background processing run as independent services, allowing us to deploy, scale, and iterate on each without affecting the others.”

---

Do you want me to **diagram CityPulse’s microservices flow** so you can show judges exactly how API, Auth, Worker, and MongoDB interact? That would make your explanation very visual and convincing.
